          <h3>GIVE A SMILE, GET A SMILE</h3>
          <p>Hello, Internet. My name is <a href="http://eliduke.com" target="_blank">Eli Duke</a>, and I need your help. I am on a mission to give away free smiles, and I am asking you to be my missionaries.</p>
          <p>I don't know exactly when or where it happened, but I that happy little bugger over there has been my favorite emoticon for about a decade now. I mean, come on! Look at that face! What a happy-go-lucky guy. He's having such a good day that his smile is wider than his face. I liked it so much that I decided to make some stickers. They were simple and clean and cheap, and I'd just give them away to friends. Then one day I was checking out at the grocery store, pulled out my cash to pay, and noticed that I had a couple smiles in my pocket.</p>
          <p>I asked the cashier, "Hey, want a sticker?"</p>
          <p>At first he seemed a little reluctant, but the second he caught a glimpse of that happy camper over there, he couldn't resist. I looked over my shoulder as I left the store and the cashier was still grinning.</p>
          <p>That got me thinking&hellip;</p>
